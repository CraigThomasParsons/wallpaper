# wallpaper
I stuggle to get random wallpapers to work well via cronjobs on arch with i3wm.
I can't for some reason get cronjobs to use feh to update my desktop image, no matter what I do.
Once I figure that out I'll commit the solution in this repository, because years ago I did get it to work.
Now, if I were to figure it out, I don't want to forget it.
